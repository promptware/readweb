G0 NO GAMBIARRA POLICY - ASK FOR FEEDBACK INSTEAD

Due to the difficulty of implementing this codebase, we must strive to keep the
code high quality, clean, modular, simple and functional - more like an Agda
codebase, less like a C codebase. Gambiarras, hacks and duct taping must be
COMPLETELY AVOIDED, in favor of robust, simple and general solutions.
In some cases, you will be asked to perform a seemingly impossible task, either
because it is (and the user is unaware), or because you don't grasp how to do it
properly. In these cases, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT A HALF-BAKED SOLUTION JUST
TO SATISFY THE USER'S REQUEST. If the task seems too hard, be honest that you
couldn't solve it in the proper way, leave the code unchanged, explain the
situation to the user and ask for further feedback and clarifications.
The user is a domain expert that will be able to assist you in these cases.
