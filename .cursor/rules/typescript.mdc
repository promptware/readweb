Use ESM only.

Avoid using `any` as much as possible. Type functions explicitly.

Prefer accepting typed records as function parameters, and type the return value:

BAD:

```
function foo(a: Param1, b: Param2) { ... }
```

GOOD:

```
function foo({a, b}: { a: Param1, b: Param2 }): Result { ... }
```

Never mute exceptions. At least log them.

Be aware of the formatter setup.

You can use these commands to check your work:

- pnpm run test
- pnpm run lint

Never reexport any definitions.

When you move something to a new file, DO NOT leave comments about the new location of the definition.

Never add backwards compatibility layers. The codebase is supposed to be always in sync, we can break APIs.
